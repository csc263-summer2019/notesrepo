# Depth First Search

Depth first search is like a BFS in that it will traverse a graph starting from a starting vertex $$s$$.  The difference is that instead of visiting the all nodes closest to$$s$$first, we follow a path as far as we can go before we backtrack.  Instead of tracking distance from s, we record a discovery time.  This discovery time can then be used to find various properties of a graph.
