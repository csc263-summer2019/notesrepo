# Breadth-first Search

Breadth-first search \(BFS\) is a method of traversing a graph $$G=(V,E)$$ starting from a source $$ s \in V $$.   BFS starts from a source vertex $$s$$.  It will then _**visits**_ every vertex $$v$$ reachable from $$s$$.   forming a BFS tree and thus finding paths from $$s$$ to $$v$$.  BFS visits nodes in order based on its distance from $$s$$

To perform a BFS on a graph, we keep track of the status of each vertex with a colour:

* white - vertex is not yet discovered in any way
* gray - vertex is encountered but not yet explored
* black - vertex is explored
